  Thaven have a unique brain structure that's similar to a positronic brain, and thus have "moods" which affect them similarly to a borg's laws.

  [color=red]Note that a thaven's moods as written are non-diegetic gameplay features. They should be treated as things that have been integrated into your character's personality, and should not be referenced by their specific names or descriptions.[/color] You may choose for your character to be aware that their behavior has changed since their last shift, but they should not be able to recite what is presented to you, the player.

  [color=#ffa500]These moods should be followed to the best of your ability![/color] A mood being violated yourself or others is uncomfortable or disquieting. The specifics of that are up to you, but if a mood is violated, you should seek to correct the mistake as soon as possible.

  [color=red]Following your moods affords you a limited license to do certain things which would otherwise be against the rules, if approached with proper escalation. If you have a question about this, don't hesitate to ask using the AHelp feature (F1).[/color]

## Mood Swings
  Thaven brains are susceptible to fluctuations in electromagnetic fields. As a result, their ability to synchronize and regulate their moods tends to degrade with extended exposure to the cosmic radiation and ion storms that permeate space stations. [color=#ffa500]It also renders them vulnerable to the EM fields generated by the Syndicate Cryptographic Sequencer, or EMAG,[/color] which can give them additional, often severely debilitating moods if used on an incapacitated thaven.

## Thaven Nerve Strike
  Thaven martial arts have a unique focus on inflicting non-permanent damage. As a result, [color=#ffa500]their unarmed attacks are slow and deal no damage,[/color] but [color=#1e90ff]cause a fair amount of stamina damage.[/color]

## Physiology
  Due to sharing a common ancestor with space carp, thaven lungs are strange, resilient organs that generate energy from the motion of respiration alone. As such, [color=#1e90ff]thaven can safely breathe any kind of atmosphere,[/color] though unlike their genetic lineage, [color=#ffa500]they're still vulnerable to asphyxiation and barotrauma.[/color]

  All thaven organs contain traces of neurons, and because of this, they take [color=#ffa500]10% more brute and cellular damage, and 20% more radiation damage.[/color] However, their unique ancestry allows them to take [color=#1e90ff]10% less heat, cold, and poison damage.[/color]

 ## Thaven Naming Conventions

  Thaven typically name themselves after a single virtue they hold dear. Sometimes these names can be long and unwieldy.
